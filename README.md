Hi!
This is a game where you need to guess a point inside a random genrated rectangle and the area of the rectangle, after the user inputs, the turtle module comes into play, it will draw the rectangle, and put a point on the canvas -> that point is you guess.
You can modify the size of the rectangle in the main.py file
Have fun!
